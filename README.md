# Creations of Classifiers and Descriptors

## Classifier creation
- Add your classifier in classifier_axiom.py file
- Don't forget to implements Classifier class
- Test your class by import and instantiate it in main.py

## Classifier Combiner creation
- Add your classifier in classifier_combine.py file
- Don't forget to implements ClassifierCombine class
- Test your class like Classifier

## Descriptor creation
- Create class that implements Descriptor (see other classes for example)
- Declare your descriptor in getImageInfo(image) method
- Instantiate your class in listDescriptors
- Test your descriptor with given code in main.py
